<h6>Waste Tire Hauling</h6>
<ul>	
	<li>We are a California Certified Waste Tire Hauler.</li>
	<li>No matter how many waste tires you have, we can haul them to a certified processor for you.</li>
	<li>In California you need to have a special permit to haul more than 8 tires at any given time, so if you have 40 tires it would take 5 trips to haul them to a processor.</li>
	<li>We can save you a lot of time by hauling 40 yards of tires per trip.</li>
</ul>
