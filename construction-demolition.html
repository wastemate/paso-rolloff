<p>We comply with SLO County’s building permit recycling requirement. You must request C&D weight tickets for proof of recycling for the county.</p>
<h6>ROLL-OFF VERSUS END-DUMP TRAILER</h6>
<ul>
	<li><b>Significant time savings:</b> It’s much easier to fill our containers versus an end-dump trailer.</li>
	<li><b>Higher per load density:</b> Our containers sit on the ground making loading them evenly much simpler.</li>
	<li><b>No hourly fees:</b> End-dump trucks are paid by the hour, where roll-offs stay at the job site.</li>
	<li><b>More compact:</b> Roll-offs fit in much tighter spaces than large trailers. </li>
	<li><b>Ability to separate materials:</b> Separate materials into multiple boxes depending on where they are headed (ex: general debris to the landfill, concrete and steel to recyclers).</li>
</ul>

<h6>Construction Debris</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Clean-up a construction site the quick, safe, and easy way.</li>
	<li>Order a container when you start a job and slowly fill it during your project.</li>
	<li>Eliminate the scrap pile that is a common hazard at many job sites.</li>
	<li>The container can be emptied as often as you need.</li>
	<li>When your project is complete we will remove it.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Demolition Debris</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Demolition projects require a high volume of outgoing material in a short time.</li>
	<li>Schedule multiple boxes for your job site and we will keep up with the demand.</li>
	<li>Our truck will initially deliver several containers then begin rotating them to the landfill or C&D processor.</li>
	<li>Schedule a dedicated driver to be on-call for efficiency in dumping loads.</li>
</ul>
