<h6>Clean-up Projects</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Load virtually any non-hazardous material into our containers.</li>
	<li>Our driver will place the container in an accessible location where you can load it at your convenience.</li>
	<li>Once you have it full or are finished with your clean-up, we will empty or remove the container.</li>
	<li>Enormous time savings using roll-off versus hauling junk by pickup truck to the landfill.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Time and Money Saved </h6>
<ul>
	<li>The Paso Robles Landfill charges a minimum of $20 per pickup load dumped.</li>
	<li>If you have a full-size truck you might be able to pack 2 yards of material into its bed, which means to make enough loads with your truck to haul the equivalent of 20 yards of junk, you’ll spend a minimum of $200 (10 trips) at the landfill.</li>
	<li>Save money on your landfill tipping fee and save yourself hours of driving back and forth to the landfill (16 miles roundtrip from town).</li>
	<li>Save time by eliminating the need to unload junk.</li>
</ul>
